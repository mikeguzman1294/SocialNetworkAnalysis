Have you ever use a professional social network such as LinkedIn? Maybe you have just subscribed (if not, do it right now!) but not really thought about how to use it.

This guided activity is an opportunity to understand how you can use LinkedIn and why LinkedIn is a success... and makes money!

To start, ask yourself these questions:

- How would you use LinkedIn to get information about a company before applying for a position?
- How can a recruiter use LinkedIn to search for a particular talent?

Did you exploit the underlying social graph to answer the previous questions? If not, we invite you to play the Kevin Bacon Game. Try also http://socilab.com/ to see your own LinkedIn ego network.

Your aim is to sign a fulltime job contract with Google. What strategy would you develop? Who could help and "place" you in an open position? Who should you contact for this? To illustrate your strategies, let's say you are "U7989".
